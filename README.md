# Motion-Detection
Created by Corinne Konoza December 2014

This was a final project for my Multimedia Programming and Design class last semester (Fall 2014). 

The title was Motion Detected Space Cat. I created this using Processing and Pure Data. Small stars 
randomly appear all over the video to add to the bleak outerspace setting. By accessing the camera,
I used the change in pixels to detect any change in motion. Movement is tracked by a cat that also 
corresponds to different musical notes as it moves across the screen. Using Pure Data, notes produced 
by sine waves play with respect to the detected motion's location on the screen to add to the 
atmosphere. So dance around and enjoy as you experience quite a colorful and interesting "space vacation".
